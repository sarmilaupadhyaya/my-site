Hello! I am Sharmila Upadhyaya trying to manage my chaotic contents by powering it with blog writing. I am working as an Natural Language Pro
essing Engineer while being Computer Science enthusiast, learning about UNIX system, Data Science, Mathematics and Programming. I am trying to learn, improve everyday, struggling to increase my attention span and abilities to explain wonders.

I have worked in text analytics (sentiment analysis, text classification), chatbots. If you have any queries regarding latest chatbot systems,
 feel free to ping me in linkedin, twitter.

Besides, I have interest in literature, music(rock, pscychedelic), poems. I try to write small unstructured poems, i might share few here.
